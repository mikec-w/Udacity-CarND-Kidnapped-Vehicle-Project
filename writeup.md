This project requires the implementation of a particle filter to locate a vehicle in a map of landmarks.

Details of running the code can be found in the ReadME file which explains the simulator and the means for communicating between the filter and the simulator.

### Results

The simulator also marks the filter for its accuracy and speed while visualising the result.

As can be seen in the figure below, the submitted implementation was successful.
